## A responsive simple calculator made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript


In this repository, I've put all the files required to design a responsive simple calculator on your web. To do so, I used a HTML file, two JS file and a CSS file. The HTML file holds the property to show the web page as a whole, the main JS file holds personalized logics & conditions, the other JS file which is a library of logics to tilt the calculator in order to make it more interactive. And the CSS file holds the entire design. The PNG file contains an image of the calculator and the MOV file contains a video that shows how the calculator should function.
